- Description
    1. AnisEulerSC
AnisEulerSC is a MATLAB-based program developed for calculating the elastic stiffness tensor of polycrystalline materials based on the self-consistent (SC) approximation. AnisEulerSC requires input data of a polycrystalline aggregate. The AnisEulerSC-Inputs program generates the input data to run the AnisEulerSC script. For analysis of crystallographic textures of minerals, several MTEX commands are used.

    1.1. AnisEulerSC-Inputs
AnisEulerSC-Inputs is a MATLAB-based program with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and developed for generating the input data of the AnisEulerSC program. Using AnisEulerSC-Inputs, the composition of a polycrystalline aggregate, the volume fractions of constituent phases, and the shapes and orientations of grains can be specified. AnisEulerSC-Inputs is designed using MATLAB (R2019a) App Designer in Mac OS X and runs in MATLAB version after R2016b in Windows or UNIX OS. In Section 2.2, an example is provided as a guideline on how to use AnisEulerSC-Inputs program.

    1.2. MTEX commands
To import, analyze and export crystallographic textures data from experimental measurements (e.g., EBSD; electron backscatter diffraction), several commands of MTEX, which is a free MATLAB toolbox for analyzing crystallographic textures (Hielscher and Schaeben, 2008), are used.
